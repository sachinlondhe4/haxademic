# Haxademic
Haxademic is a multimedia platform, built in Java and [Processing](http://processing.org/). It's a starting point for interactive visuals, giving you a unified environment for both realtime and rendering modes. It loads several Java libraries and wraps them up to play nicely with each other. It solves a number of problems faced by (potentially) thread-unsafe hardware inputs like audio, Kinect, MIDI and OSC. To view some projects created with the library, check out the [Haxademic Tumblr](http://haxademic.com/).

## State of affairs
While the code has been open-sourced, I haven't had time to write much (any) documentation, but I'm trying to get it there. You can see the example apps and sketches to get an idea of how to use various features. Even without fully installing everything, there's plenty of interesting code within, and I fully endorse borrowing it however you see fit in the meantime. If you're interested in collaborating, please contact me via my [GitHub account](http://github.com/cacheflowe), or my [web site](http://cacheflowe.com/?page=contact). If you'd like help getting the project running, follow the instructions below.

## Installing / Compiling
* Download the standard Eclipse IDE for Java development, and the Java Development Kit itself:
	* [Eclipse](http://www.eclipse.org/)
	* [JDK](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html)
* [Download](http://code.google.com/p/simple-openni/downloads/list) and install the latest SimpleOpenNI (Kinect) drivers with the [instructions](http://code.google.com/p/simple-openni/wiki/Installation) for your particular platform
* Clone or [download](https://github.com/cacheflowe/haxademic/archive/master.zip) the Haxademic project
* Open Eclipse and: **File -> Import -> General / Existing Projects into Workspace**
	* Choose the `haxademic` directory that you cloned/downloaded, press **Finish**, and the project should be ready to use
* Make sure you're compiling with Java 1.6 instead of the new default of 1.7:
	* Right-click the `haxademic` project in the **Package Explorer** or **Navigator** window and click **Properties**
	* Click the **Java Compiler** section and check the **Enable project specific settings** box on the right
	* Select **1.6** as your **Compiler compliance level**, if possible
	* If "Configure the **Installed JREs**" is shown at the bottom of this window, click that, make sure the **1.6** item is checked, then click OK.
* Right-click on a PApplet or PAppletHax subclass within `src` and choose **Run As -> Java Applet** from the menu. Hopefully you're seeing something awesome at this point.

Haxademic uses the following Java & Processing libraries, which I've included in this repository so you don't have to find them yourself (more on that below):

* [Processing](http://processing.org/) (view the [Processing for Eclipse instructions](http://processing.org/learning/eclipse/))
* [ESS](http://www.tree-axis.com/Ess/)
* [simple-openni](http://code.google.com/p/simple-openni/)
* [toxiclibs](http://toxiclibs.org/)
* [p5sunflow](https://github.com/hryk/p5sunflow) original site is down :-/
* [OBJLoader](http://code.google.com/p/saitoobjloader/)
* [themidibus](https://github.com/sparks/themidibus)
* [oscP5](http://www.sojamo.de/libraries/oscP5/)
* [fullscreen](http://www.superduper.org/processing/fullscreen_api/)
* [He_Mesh](http://hemesh.wblut.com/)
* [minim](http://code.compartmental.net/tools/minim/)

* [blobDetection](http://www.v3ga.net/processing/BlobDetection/)
* [Java Image Filters](http://www.jhlabs.com/ip/filters/index.html)
* [Super CSV](http://supercsv.sourceforge.net/)

Use the following VM Arguments when running the Java Application

* `-d32` (when rendering to Quicktime movie or using a web cam)
* `-Xmx1024M`
* `-Xms1024M`

General Use / Tips

* If you get a Quicktime error, try adding `-d32` to your VM arguments when compiling. 
* If you want to wipe your `bin/` directory, you'll have to do a **Project -> Cleanâ€¦** in Eclipse afterwards.

## Todo
* Comment the codebase and generate docs
* Create a unified keyboard/MIDI/OSC input system with improved midi/osc data handling
* Clean up legacy code that's no longer used
* Lots more noted in the PAppletHax class comments

## Licensing

The Haxademic codebase and apps are [MIT licensed](https://raw.github.com/cacheflowe/haxademic/master/LICENSE), so do what you want with these files. Feel free to let me know that you're using it for something cool. I've added 3rd-party .jar files and compiled Java libraries that I'm probably not actually allowed to redistribute here, so if you're the owner of one of those libraries and would like the files removed, let me know. I've included them to aid those who would like a quick start and not have to search for the many dependencies of this project. Some of these libraries have disappeared from the web entirely, so searching for them may be futile anyway. I just want people to make cool things with this library, and hope you understand.
